# HRP392


This is a repo for the course HRP392/BIOMEDIN432 at Stanford University. 

The repo contains four R files. One is for the homework and the three others are for the final project.

```finding_transition_probabilities.R``` is for estimating the transition probabilities when you only know the Kaplan-Meier curves.

```CEA.R``` is the main file for doing the cost-effectivness analysis. It calls on ```finding_transition_probabilities.R```.

```sensitivity_analysis.R``` does the sensitivity analysis.
